# DVAE26 Project

## Description
CNN-based image recognition model using the MNIST dataset. It includes data augmentation, training, model evaluation, and deployment on Hugging Face.

## Dataset
- MNIST Dataset: A standard dataset containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Workflow Pipeline

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Normalization
- Data Augmentated (rotation, shifting, etc.)

### 2. Model Development
- Implemented CNN using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Hyperparameter tuning

### 3. Training
- Experimented with different hyperparameters

### 4. Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix

### 5. Deployment
- Deployed the trained model on **Hugging Face**

### 6. Software Engineering Practices
- Version control with Git
- Modular code structure

## Results & Key Findings

### Model Performance
- Accuracy: 99.43
- Precision/Recall: 99.43

### Test out the model
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ishaqezaz/DVAE26-mnist-cnn)

## Data Quality Report

### Measures Taken
- Applied data augmentation
- Ensured clean and well-structured dataset
